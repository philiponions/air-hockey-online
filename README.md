# Air Hockey Online

A prelude to something bigger.
I havent done any sort of programming at all over the past 3 months and I've been meaning to make something. However I was afraid I might have been washed up. So I made a little air hockey game in plain js + html and css.
This is a bit of a warm up to the real thing i'll be making.
